Description: A pure Lua Postgres driver for use in OpenResty & more
 pgmoon is a PostgreSQL client library written in pure Lua (MoonScript).
 .
 pgmoon was originally designed for use in OpenResty to take advantage of
 the cosocket api to provide asynchronous queries but the necessary
 functionality is also available from nginx-extras. It also works in the
 regular Lua environment as well using LuaSocket. For MD5 authentication,
 use OpenResty/nginx-extras or install LuaCrypto with luarocks. To allow
 secure connections with TLS, use LuaSec (lua-sec package). pgmoon can
 also use cqueues' socket when passed "cqueues" as the socket type when
 instantiating, available through luarocks.
 .
 It's a perfect candidate for running your queries both inside an
 OpenResty/nginx-extras environment and on the command line (eg. tests)
 in web frameworks like Lapis.
